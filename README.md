# Sorting Algorithms

A collection of classic sorting algorithm implementations in Python, ideal for learning and practice.

## Features

- **Bubble Sort**  
  Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order; simple but inefficient for large lists.

- **Insertion Sort**  
  Builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position; efficient for small or nearly sorted lists.

- **Merge Sort**  
  Divides the list into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves; efficient and stable with guaranteed O(n log n) time.

- **Quick Sort**  
  Uses a pivot to partition the list and recursively sorts partitions; very fast on average but worst-case O(nÂ²).

- **Selection Sort**  
  Selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the front; simple but inefficient for large lists.

- **Shell Sort**  
  Generalization of insertion sort that allows exchanges of elements far apart; improves efficiency by reducing total swaps.
